Chapter 1 notes

The examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. 

Each example is called a training instance or sample. 

The part that learns and makes predictions is the mode. Neural networks and random forests for example. 

Different types of machine learning are available, supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised, Reinforcement, batch learning and online learning. 

Supervised learning: 
Spam detection
Housing price based on sqft. 

Unsupervised learning: 
Clustering, similar to who is visiting your website. 
Addtionally Anomoly detection. 

Reinformcement: 
Let a robot make a decision based on a policy and either reward if correct or penalize if incorrect decisions are made. 

Data is the main goal here, data needs to be representive of the problem, and needs to be clean and good data. 

The model is generally dependent on the data, but you want to make sure it doesn't only work on the training data, needs to be able to generalize as well. 

Aha moment for today is the amount of options there are for Machine Learning and all the different applications available. 

Question I still have, is how do you select the right data, and the right model?
